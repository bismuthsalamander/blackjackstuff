Archived here for posterity.  This repository contains unfinished code I wrote while studying advantage play (AP) blackjack using hi/low counting.  There is no command-line interface or organized output; this code is purely in an investigatory and experimental state.  I decided to abandon the project of playing semi-professionally and never finished this software.  The simulations were returning numbers fairly close to those generate by CV/CX, the standard tool for evaluating blackjack AP strategies.  This tool included most of the fundamental techniques, including true count calculations, common betting patterns based on the true count, wonging (waiting to enter a shoe until the true count reaches a certain positive threshold and/or leaving a shoe when the count drops too low), and some basic strategy deviations (making hit/stand/split/double decisions that differ from basic strategy when it is profitable to do so based on the true count).
